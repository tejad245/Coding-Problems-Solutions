#Curious Shubham (100 Marks)
#There are 26 groups of people in Shubham's Company. At lunchtime, they all want to get some food to eat as soon as possible.
#All the groups have made plan to get some food as soon as possible. According to the plan, every person of the group will share the description of food he/she wants to eat so that all the group members will be able to order the food on the behalf of his/her group. 
#All the persons stand at various locations in the queue and whoever will get the food first, will distribute the food among all the group.
